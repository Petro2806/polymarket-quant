Overview:
This assignment evaluates your core quantitative market-making skills: 
analyzing market microstructure, 
reasoning about spreads/volatility/flow, 
designing a simple MM model, and running a minimal simulation.
 

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 1 - CORE DATA ANALYSIS
------------------------------------------------------------
 
1. Spread and Liquidity
- Compute bid–ask spreads for each market.
- Identify the 3 markets with the tightest spreads and the 3 with the widest.
- Briefly explain what spreads imply about liquidity, competition, and expected edge.
 
2. Volatility
- Compute a simple 3-hour rolling volatility of mid-price.
- Identify the most and least volatile markets.
- Explain how volatility affects market-making risk and spread decisions.
 
3. Flow and Drift
- Compute net taker flow: taker_buy - taker_sell.
- Determine whether sustained flow imbalance predicts short-term price drift.
- Explain in a few sentences why flow imbalance matters to a market maker.
 
------------------------------------------------------------
PART 2 - STRATEGY DESIGN
------------------------------------------------------------
 
Design a simple, realistic Polymarket market-making model. Include:
 
1. Quoting Logic
- How you set bid/ask levels relative to mid-price.
- When and why you widen spreads (e.g., volatility spikes, flow imbalance, thin books).
 
2. Inventory Control
- Maximum inventory allowed.
- Rules for rebalancing when inventory becomes skewed.
- Conditions under which you pause quoting.
 
3. Refresh Rules
- Define what counts as a "material" price move.
- When to refresh vs when to keep existing quotes to avoid unnecessary churn.
 
------------------------------------------------------------
PART 3 - MINIMAL SIMULATION
------------------------------------------------------------
 
Build a lightweight simulation over the dataset:
- Simulate fills using simple crossing logic.
- Track inventory, PnL, and quote activity.
- Compute summary results:
 - net PnL
 - maximum inventory load
 - average spread quoted
 
Provide a brief interpretation of:
- what worked,
- what failed,
- what you would change in a next iteration.
 
For Part 3: feels free to do simulation, running real market making on polymarket will earn extra points+

BONUS (Optional)
------------------------------------------------------------ 
A) Explain why negative-risk markets behave differently from regular markets.  
B) Describe a simple rule-based method for detecting informed trading using prices and flow.
